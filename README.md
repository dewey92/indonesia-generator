# indonesia-generator
A very simple app to count how many "indonesia" stickers are needed to create another sticker with custom sentence,
e.g "idea is one asia" sticker will need 3 "indonesia" stickers to print, and "asia" needs 2 "indonesia" stickes.

## How to use
Compile using `stack ghci --ghci-options app/Main.hs`, then type `main`. Invalid input will always prompt you until
it accepts the correct one
